  Purpose:
  This is the main HTML file for the CASFOS Grievance Redressal System frontend React application.
  It sets up the document structure, meta tags for SEO, and the root div for React rendering.

  Features:
  - Sets viewport, theme color, and SEO meta tags (description, keywords, author).
  - Includes favicon for branding.
  - Provides a root div for React to mount the app.
  - Displays a noscript message if JavaScript is disabled.

  Usage:
  This file is used as the entry point for the React app. Do not remove the root div.

  Notes:
  - All content is static except for the root div, which is managed by React.
  - Meta tags should be updated as needed for SEO and branding.
